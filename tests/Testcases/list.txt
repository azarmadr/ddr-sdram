The address for SDRAM is {ba1,ba0, row addressbits, column address bits}. Two bit byte enables select what bytes out of 4 (32 bits) is
            required.
            Write these r test cases and test.
            Fiix one programming of mode reg with one set of values

            1) Write  1 beat to each bank (4 banks) one after another.  Look if there are any gaps between bank writing
            2)  Read 1 beat to each bank (4 banks) one after another.  Look if there are any gaps between bank reading.
            3) Do the same as (1)  (2) with 2 banks read, 2 banks  write.
            4) Write at the end of the row to spill to the next row (do with each bank 4 tests)
            5) Read at the end of the row to spill to the next row (do with each bank 4 tests)
            6) write to spill over bank x to bank x+1. ( starting at the end of last row in a bank)
            7)  read o spill over bank x to bank x+1.
